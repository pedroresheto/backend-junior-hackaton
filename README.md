I has made backend app on Django REST framework for hackaton. Thats crud server

For unpacking you also need downloaded python pn your computer
and also create venv (use i python3-venv) and after activate venv (source venv/bin/activate)

Need to instal paclages:
1. Django (from 4.2 version)
2. djangorestframework
3. django-cors-headers
4. pycopg2-binary

And alao using Postgres like db
